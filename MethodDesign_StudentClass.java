 * 
 * Project Plan:
 * Goal: Each student has 3 courses. In each course, they took a test and got a test score. Find the average of the 3 test scores for each student. 
 * 
 * 3 Classes: Driver (main), Student, Course
 * 
 * The Course class will have 2 variables for the name and test scores. 
 * There will be setters and getters to establish the test score for the specific course.
 * Remember to initialize the test score to 0. 
 * 
 * The Student class will use the Course class.
 * This class will have 2 variables for the student name and for a list of courses. 
 * Have the driver class declare the 3 classes for each student. In the student class, try having a setter and getter for the whole course list. 
 * Each student gets 3 courses (use the Course class)
 * Overload the constructor
 * Add setters and getters for the test scores. These scores will be pulled from the Course class. 
 * Find the average of the 3 test scores. 
 * Have a for loop that cycles 3 times. Each time, it goes to the Course class, and uses the getter method to get the test score from the Course class. 
 * Each time the loop is run, add a new test score to the total score (add 3 of them up). 
 * Finally, divide the total score by 3 to find the average score. 
 * Have a toString that outputs the studentâ€™s name, 3 courses, 3 test scores of each course, and the average score. 
 * The toString will have a loop similar to the getTestScore loop. This loop will use the Course class for test scores. 
 * 
 * The main driver class will initialize each student object. 
 * Student objects will include the student's name and 3 courses. 
 * There will also be setters for the test scores to go into the Course class. 
 * Remember to print everything out.
